Portfolio site for Franco Ortega.

The inspiration for this site came from my love of fantasy cartography. From the world of Middle Earth when I was younger to the lands of the Grishaverse more recently, I have always enjoyed flipping back to the maps in fantasy novels whenever a new location is mentioned in the story and seeing where it is located in relation to other places already visited.
